# HWM Thesis Scripts

Dear reader,

This repository contains all scripts that I have created for my HWM Thesis. I tried to organize it in such a way that the script that are made for the same objective are in the same folder; RQ1, RQ2 or RQ3. The assisting scripts are generally scripts that are being called upon in the main scripts. 

Typically the names of the scripts should indicate what the script does, as I did not always explain it very clearly inside the scripts. As there are so many of them, I chose to not do this now either. Therefore, if you are interested in something in particular, but are unable to find it, feel free to contact me (e.g. through my GitHub account). You can also contact me for the input data that I used for my research, which was channel 12 HRV data from Meteosat Second Generation satellite.

I do have a general instruction for using the scripts, regarding the folder structure. Many script expect the following structure:\\
      disk:\Thesis\Scripts\   <-  In this folder go my scripts, using the same structure as this repository.
      disk:\Thesis\Data\      <-  In this folder go the data folders
It does not matter on which disk drive the folders are created, as this is typically defined at the start of each script

Greetings,
Rob Maas
